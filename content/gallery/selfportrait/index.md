*"The moment" could be anything--a big sports competition, a class speech, or even something small, like taking a quiz. The length of the event could be quite long, maybe several hours. Yet I've noticed how it pales in comparison to the substantial anxiety I would feel in the many days leading up.*

*I've come to see it as a universal struggle, worse than others for some. How do I deal with it? How do I deal with the ever-rising pressure as the time separating me from "the moment" shrinks from days, to hours, to minutes?*

*For each of these moments, I find there comes a time where I have prepared all I could have. Reread, rehearsed, memorized, everything. In the charcoal I captured an expression I strongly recall making in the mirror, as I readied for my first soloist performance in my district band. What was going through my head?*

*"All those feelings? Screw them! You've done all you could, and you've done it spectacularly! Now it is time. Go show them!"*
