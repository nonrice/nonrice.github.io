*A skeleton lies at the bottom of the oceans, all alone. A few of his belongings surround him, but not to his benefit--his sword is rusty and dull, and his riches are spilled open, ready to be plundered. Yet even in this unraveled state, the skeleton takes on a peculiar appearance with its vibrant colors. The pursuit of prestige is fast-paced and chaotic, but when events come to a rest, or perhaps unfortunately, to a permanent rest, one realizes how real happiness is found from within, ingrained boldly and vividly into their very bones.*
