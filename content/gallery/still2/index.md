*This piece highlights my curiosity towards the evolution of computer hardware, focusing on the northbridge heatsink. This was a once-crucial part that that cooled the northbridge, which manages data flow between the CPU and other components. Nowadays the northbridge is largely integrated into the CPU itself, rendering the northbridge heatsink obsolete. Iâ€™ve used a fiery golden hue to honor this component's past significance as a small tribute to the progression of technology.*
