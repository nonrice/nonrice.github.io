*In this modern kitchen, a robotic chef stands as a marvel of engineering. Yet just outside, an untouched wilderness grows, in contrast to the advanced technology within. The bold green of nature, despite being in the background, speaks to its enduring presence, yet simultaneously conveys nature's relegation to an afterthought in the pursuit of progress. It captures the tension between innovation and environment, demonstrated in the sidelined treatment of nature in industries like lithium mining, with its role in battery production forming the backbone of technology development today. However, this work does imagine a distant future, leaving room for hope--maybe by then, humanity's relationship with nature and technology will have changed for the better.*
