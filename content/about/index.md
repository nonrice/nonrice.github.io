I am a student at McLean High School in Fairfax County. I have been programming for several years and I like competitive programming. I also like to make web-based applications and data science projects.

Away from the computer, I enjoy distance running, competitive Tetris, playing clarinet, and jump rope.

Much of my work is on my Github. Give it a visit!
