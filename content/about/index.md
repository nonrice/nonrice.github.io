I am a student at McLean High School in Fairfax County. I have been programming for several years--right now I especially like competitive programming. I also spend time making [web-based applications and data science projects.](https://github.com/nonrice)

Away from the computer, I enjoy drawing, distance running, cycling, and playing frisbee. I'm also a competitive Tetris player!
