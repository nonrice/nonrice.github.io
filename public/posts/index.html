                <p>Everyone knows the traditional binary search algorithm using $l$ and $r$ pointers. However to new CPers it is especially easy to make a bounds mistake. When I can&rsquo;t use <code>lower_bound</code> or the like I implement a different method of binary searching. It is similar to the binary lifting technique for trees.</p>
