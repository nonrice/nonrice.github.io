      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around one year ago, I was a completely different runner than I am today. My cross country season ended in shambles with a stress fracture&amp;ndash;I was unable to run even a single mile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am back to working in WhiskerToolbox. Having knowledge on dynamic linking and app bundling on MacOS became very useful, as it turned out the target audience for this app was mainly Mac users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is the problem: &amp;ldquo;Given an array $a$ of length $n$ where, $1\leq a_i\leq 10^9$ and $1\leq n\leq 10^5$, count the ordered pairs $(i, j)$ such that $i&amp;lt;j$ and $a_i\&amp;amp; a_j = 0$ where $\&amp;amp;$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SQRT Decomposition On Queries</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can use SQRT Decomposition On Queries to solve range query problems with some kind of update operation. It is not as well documented as two popular algorithm SQRT based algorithms (Mo&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm, SQRT Decomposition).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Easier Binary Search</title>
      <link>https://widefin.com/posts/easierbinarysearch/</link>

      <guid>https://widefin.com/posts/easierbinarysearch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the traditinal binary search algorithm using $l$ and $r$ pointers. However to new CPers it is especially easy to make a bounds mistake. When I can&amp;rsquo;t use &lt;code&gt;lower_bound&lt;/code&gt; or the like I implement a different method of binary searching. It is similar to the binary lifting technique for trees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
